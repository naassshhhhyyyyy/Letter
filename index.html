                <p>Dear Jillian,</p>
                <p>It’s hard to believe that we’re finally graduating. As we reach this milestone, I’ve been thinking about everything that’s happened over the years, especially the moments we’ve shared.</p>
                <p>From the very first time I saw you, I was captivated by your beautiful eyes and that adorable smile. At first, I thought you were the quiet type, someone who kept to herself. But as I got to know you, I quickly realized there’s so much more to you. You’re lively, talkative, and have this fun, slightly mischievous side that I never saw coming. It’s one of the many things I love about you.</p>
                <p>When I confessed my feelings to you back in January, I was so nervous. I knew it was a risk, but I couldn’t keep it to myself any longer. Even though you told me you weren’t ready, I’m glad we stayed friends. Our friendship means the world to me, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>
                <p>As we both head off to whatever’s next, I just wanted you to know how much you mean to me. You’ll always have a special place in my heart, and I’m so grateful for the memories we’ve made. I hope we can keep in touch, no matter where life takes us.</p>
                <p>Take care of yourself, Jillian, and don’t forget to enjoy every moment of what’s ahead. Maybe someday, when the timing is right, our paths will cross again in a different way. But for now, I’m just thankful I got to know someone as incredible as you.</p>
                <p>With all my best,</p>
                <p>Nash</p>
